# Old Project

I started programming back when I was in grammar school. Starting in 1999 with
I soon dived into various progamming languages and tried out what I could get
into my hands.
It started with Java Script, where I happened to pick up a book from my fathers
library by accident. Soon I moved to Visual Basic 6 and then Java.
Wanting to better understand how everything works under the hood, I had to add
x86 assembler to that list, before I started to settle for a bit with C++.

My first 'real' programming project then was a joint thesis project with two
class mates.

## [Elektron (2001)](Elektron/Elektron.md)

Having not the slightest clue how difficult it would turn out, we convinced our
teacher that we would develop a cross-platform (Windows 9x, MacOS 9) simulation
program for simple electrical circuits.

## Queue (2005)

As part of the software engineering class, we were supposed to design and
implement a game. In a small team of thee, we built a 3D billiard game.

## Digital Circuit Simulation (2005)

Digital circuit design was fun. Towards the end of the semester I was wandering
if it would be possible to build a simulator for simple circuit designs using
C# delegates.

## From Eiffel to C# (2005)

Believes are strong motivator to do things. And back in the summer of 2005 I
believed that I had to my univerity collegues that C# was better than Eiffel,
the language we were using in lectures. So, I organised a small workshop and
prepared some slides and written documenation. In order to get some practice,
my 'student's had to implement a small UI application within a small framework.

## Gravity Bound (2007)

## Auto-vectorizer (2007)

## Dark Physics (2007)

## Raytracer (2007)
